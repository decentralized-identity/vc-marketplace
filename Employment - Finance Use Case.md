# Employment - Finance Use Case

### Goals
This use case document focuses on creating useer story for the VC Marketplace and aims to provide solutions to the following problems:
1. As a verifier, how can I communicate what's needed (which credentials) to provide the service to the holder?
2. As a verifier, how can I:
    - Check if holder credentails of a certain type
    - Check if those credentials are issued by specific issuer
    - Check if crednetials are not revoked
    - Check if issuer DID is not compromised
3. How can verifier incentivize issuers to create more VCs?
4. How can marketplace facilitate discovery and re-use of the credentials?
5. How can issuers communicate what types of VCs can they issue on demand?

We're focusing on the use cases of providing employment information via verifiable credentials in order for the holder to get access to various services (banking, housing).
